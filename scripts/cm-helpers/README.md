## OSC ConfigMap Configurator

./pp-cm-helper.sh is an interactive Bash script designed to assist in populating the peer-pods-cm
ConfigMap, which is essential for configuring Peer Pods or CoCo.
The script intelligently suggests default values based on metadata collected from the cluster's
cloud provider, recommended best practices, and user-provided input.

### Supported Cloud Providers

* Azure
* Libvirt
* GCP

### Prerequisites
* jq, kubectl or oc installed
* Preconfigured OCP cluster with OSC Operator installed

   -h              Print this help message
   -v <KEY=value>  Set a known or custom variable explicitly
   -y              Automatically answer yes for all questions
