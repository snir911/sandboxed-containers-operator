# This is a hack to enable hermetic builds for the operator.
# Rather than installing controller-gen, we declare it as a dependency in the
# go.mod file. Cachi2/Hermeto will then get the sources as part of the prefetch
# phase.
# Once the sources are in, we can use "go run" to build and run the tool from
# its sources, without needing access to the network.
#
# In order to keep the Makefile untouched (as it is partly generated from
# operator-sdk), we put this script in the location where the Makefile expect
# to find controller-gen.
# Makefile will then NOT install the tool, and just run the script instead.

go run sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools/cmd/controller-gen $@
